        on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than cargo.[1][2] There
        are around one billion cars in use worldwide

        The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss
        inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in
        1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German
        inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
